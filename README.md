AI539 - The final project where I present a detailed analysis of challenges and strategies in machine learning, focusing on handling missing values, outliers, and class imbalance in a dataset related to glacier tongue activity.

Models Used: DecisionTreeClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, and 9-KNeighborsClassifier, with a baseline comparison using DummyClassifier.

The report underscores the effectiveness of specific strategies for each challenge. Linear regression imputation emerged as the most effective method for handling missing values, while the IQR method was most beneficial for outliers. Setting the class weight to 'balanced' for class imbalance proved most effective. These findings illustrate the complexities of machine learning model tuning and underscore the importance of choosing the right data preprocessing and model optimization strategy.
